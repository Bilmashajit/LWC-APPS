It's a simple #lightning component. Write on the text area, # symbol shows you snippet list, pick one tag, and continue writing.

Hope you like to learn something #interesting and #easy in #LWC. To make things simple just work on the JavaScript list not used any apex, you can use it easily. There are scopes to work on, recently I am working on it, any open can participate, and it opens for all.

Git URL: https://lnkd.in/e2vtrTv
Component: extendTextEditor,extendTextEditorContainer
Branch: master

Here we can learn:
· Reuse component (extendTextEditorContainer).
· Popup on the event.
· Base on text input, fire event.
· Search on list
· Add on list
· Work on the data-table.
· Refresh data-table, text input


I got this idea from the #vscode snippet.
